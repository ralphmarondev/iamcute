# 🦄 iamcute 🦄

Crafted with care by the one and only **Ralph Maron Eda** ✨

Here, web spells are cast with the power of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and XAMPP—sparkling with creativity and fun!

## What's this repository all about?

This repository was formerly known as **xamppicorn**, but we changed it to **iamcute** to align with our group name. I created this repository to store my codes from my online technology class, where I can showcase my learning journey!

## What’s inside the magic forest?

- 🌸 **HTML Whispers** – where the structure of dreams is built.
- 🎨 **CSS Rainbows** – because every unicorn needs some stylish flair!
- 🎯 **JS Jumps** – for all the bouncing, interactive magic.
- 🧩 **PHP Mysteries** – solving puzzles, one server-side spell at a time.
- 🏰 **XAMPP Castle** – the magical fortress where all the adventures live!

## Why iamcute?

Because coding is way more fun when there's a cute twist involved! 🦄 Whether you're crafting digital rainbows or building castles in code, **iamcute** is here to make the journey a little more magical.
