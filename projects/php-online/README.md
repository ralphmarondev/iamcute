## 🛠 How to Run

To get started, make sure you have **PHP** and **XAMPP** installed on your system. Here's how to set them up:

### 1. Install PHP and XAMPP

You'll need to install both PHP and a local server like XAMPP to run the project. Follow the steps below to install them.

- **[Download PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads)**:

  - Follow the installation instructions on the official PHP website.
  - Once installed, make sure PHP is in your system's PATH to run it from the terminal.

- **[Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)**:
  - XAMPP is an easy-to-install Apache distribution that includes PHP, MySQL, and more.
  - Download the version that suits your operating system (Windows).
  - Install XAMPP and launch the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 2. Configure PHP & XAMPP

- **For Windows**:
  - After installing XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel.
  - Start the **Apache** server to enable the local server.
  - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost` to verify that the server is working.

### 3. Run the Project

Once you've installed and configured PHP and XAMPP, you can run the project:

1. **Open your terminal** 🚀
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Make sure you have a **Bash terminal** installed (such as **Git Bash** or any other Bash-compatible terminal).
4. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

This will launch the project, and you can start exploring the lessons right in your browser! 🎉
